Rust is a reddish-brown flaky substance that forms on the surface of iron and steel when they react with oxygen and moisture. This chemical reaction, known as corrosion, deteriorates the metal over time. Rust is essentially iron oxide, specifically hydrous iron(III) oxides and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide.
