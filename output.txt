average sales = ?</s>
Answer:
320</s>
Explanation:

To calculate the average sales for all customers, we need to add up the sales of all customers and divide it by the number of customers.
In this case, the sales of each customer are:
A - 300
B - 500
C - 12
D - 400
So, the total sales are:
300 + 500 + 12 + 400 = 1212
Now, let's divide the total sales by the number of customers:
1212 / 4 = 303
So, the average sales for all customers is 303.</s><s> everybody</s>
